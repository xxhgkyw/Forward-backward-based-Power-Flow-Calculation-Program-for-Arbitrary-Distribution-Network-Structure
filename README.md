# Forward-backward-based-Power-Flow-Calculation-Program-for-Arbitrary-Distribution-Network-Structure
This is a python program about forward-backward-based power flow calculation for arbitrary distribution network structure.
There are 4 scripts here, 3 main code for IEEE 33-node distribution system, textbook exercise problem 3-3 and 3-4, respectively.
Script "Supplement code" seals the necessary code for application in different circumstances, and will remain unchanged all the time.
You can run different "main code" to test this algorithm in different distribution systems, or create a new one if you like.
